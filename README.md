# Azure Machine Learning Examples - Predicting Remaining Useful Life of TurboFan

![ds design](/images/datascience.png)

This collections of examples highlights the flexibility of Azure Machine Learning Service.

## [Example 1. Azure Machine Learning with Local Python Code](/python)
  We will look at how easy it is to leverage the Azure ML python SDKs with local python code to start tracking experiment metrics, registering models and the deploying our models.

## [Example 2: Azure Machine Learning & Databricks](/databricks)
Finally we will introduce combining Spark with Azure Machine Learning through the use of Databricks and Spark.ML. Here we will also intr

## [Example 3. Azure Machine Learning Notebooks](/notebooks)
Here we will move away from worrying about our local development environment and look at Azure Machine Learning Notebooks.

## [Example 4. Azure Machine Learning Designer](/designer)
Then we will use the data building a 'no-code' solution in Azure Machine Learning Designer:

## [Example 5. Azure Machine Learning AutoML](/automl)
Now we 

## [Example 6: Azure Machine Learning & Databricks](/databricks)
Finally we will introduce combining Spark with Azure Machine Learning through the use of Databricks and Spark.ML. Here we will also intr



- Using Azure Machine Learning Service (AML) Python SDK from [Local Environment](python/local/)
   - Track local experiments using Azure Machine Learning Workspace
   - Register ML models and deploy to Azure Container Instance
- Using AML to change [compute targets](python/local/compute)
   - Train with both local and cloud compute
- Azure AI/ML & [MLOps](python/local/devops) (Pipelines and Azure DevOps)
   - Build and deploy an Azure Machine Learning [Pipeline](python/local/pipeline) for model training, model registration and model deployment.
   - Scripts for CD/CD with Azure [DevOps](python/local/devops)
