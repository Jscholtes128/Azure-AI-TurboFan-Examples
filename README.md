This collections of examples highlights the flexibility of Azure Machine Learning Service.

## [Getting Started](/setup)
Please start here to ensure you are ready to start working through the examples.

## [Example 1: Azure Machine Learning with Local Python Code](/python)
  We will look at how easy it is to leverage the Azure ML python SDKs with local python code to start tracking experiment metrics, registering models and the deploying our models.

## [Example 2: Azure Machine Learning Pipeline](/pipeline)
Finally we will introduce combining Spark with Azure Machine Learning through the use of Databricks and Spark.ML. Here we will also intr

## [Example 3: Azure Machine Learning Notebooks](/notebooks)
Here we will move away from worrying about our local development environment and look at Azure Machine Learning Notebooks.

## [Example 4. Azure Machine Learning Designer](/designer)
Then we will use the data building a 'no-code' solution in Azure Machine Learning Designer:

## [Example 5. Azure Machine Learning AutoML](/automl)
Now we 

## [Example 6: Azure Machine Learning & Databricks](/Databricks)
Finally we will introduce combining Spark with Azure Machine Learning through the use of Databricks and Spark.ML. Here we will also intr

## [Example 7: MLOPs with Azure DevOps](/devops)
