# Azure Machine Learning Examples leverage the NASA Turbofan dataset for the following:

- Using Azure Machine Learning Service (AML) Python SDK from [Local Environment](python/local/)
   - Track local experiments using Azure Machine Learning Workspace
   - Register ML models and deploy to Azure Container Instance
- Using AML to change [compute targets](python/local/compute)
   - Train with both local and cloud compute
- Azure AI/ML & [MLOps](python/local/devops) (Pipelines and Azure DevOps)
   - Build and deploy an Azure Machine Learning [Pipeline](python/local/pipeline) for model traning, model registration and model deployment.
   - Scripts for CD/CD with Azure [DevOps](python/local/devops)
